This is the homework for week six. The objective is to build a weather application that retrieves data from an external API to view the weather of a city of interest. After typing entering a city as input and clicking on the submit button, the HTML and CSS code will be updated and the application will display current and future weather conditions for the city of interest. Displayed information will include: city name, date, icon representation, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. There will also be a search history displayed under the search bar and can be cleared with the clear button.
